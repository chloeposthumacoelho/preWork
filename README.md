The Tip Calculator I created took approximately 3.5 hours and is intended for iOS.

✏️ The calculator allows user(s) to browse between different tip percentages they may choose to select, between 15, 18 and 20%.

✏️ These chosen values are immediately updated once user clicks on it.

✏️The app overall allows the user to see the total amount of their tip based on the value of their bill.

future goals:

✏️I hope to implement a tip sharing feature, where users in groups can see how much each individual guest must pay as a tip.

✏️I also hope to implement a currency feature that allows user to select different currencies for their tip calculations.
