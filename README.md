The Tip Calculator I created took approximately 3.5 hours and is intended for ios.
-The calculator allows user(s) to browse between different tip percentages they may choose to select, between 15, 18 and 20%.
-These chosen values are immediately updated once user clicks on it.
-The app also offers a keyboard that immediately pulls up so the user can type with more ease.
-The app overall allows the user to see the total amount of their tip based on the value fo their bill.
For the future:
-I hope to implement a tip sharing feature, where users in groups can see how much each individual guest must pay as a tip.
